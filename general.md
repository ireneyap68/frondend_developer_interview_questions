4. When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance? 
- Reduce external HTTP requests
    - In many cases, a large portion of a website's load time comes from external HTTP requests. The speed at which an external resource loads can vary depending on the hosting provider's server infrastructure, location, etc. Your first goal when reducing external HTTP requests should be to examine your website with a minimalist outlook. Study each component of your webpages, and eliminate any features that do not improve the experience of your visitors. These features may be:
        1. Unnecessary images
        2. Unnecessary JavaScript
        3. Excessive CSS
        4. Unnecessary plugins

6. Can you explain any common techniques or recent issues solved in regards to front-end security?
- Front-end validation is important! In fact, there’s a lot of client-side attack vectors that you should worry about. In particular, two you should worry about are cross-site scripting (XSS) and malware in third party libraries you’re using.

- To give an example of how this is a client-side concern, consider the [Magecart malware](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/what-magecart-credit-card-stealing-malware-proves-hard-stop-n948176). Major websites like Ticketmaster, Forbes, and British Airways have been affected when code they were relying on was modified to include credit card skimming Javascript. This malware monitored the page for credit card inputs, then sent the data back to its servers. Since it all happened entirely in the browser, no company internal firewall or server agent would have detected it.
